## ThreadTogether Fashion Item Classification and Recommendation System
### **I.   Project Proposal**
    There are 2 main sources of input data that Thread Together(TT)leverages –Image and web data. Our present proposal pertains tomining the web data via text analytics.  

    There are **4 primary objectives:**
    **A.Attribution of web data**–TT will provide a dataset previously extracted from various retail websites, we would like to organize and extract meaningful product informationfrom the web data.

    **B.Attribution tool/app**–As a supplement to extracting features from current datasets, wepropose the development of a text parsing app that would provide a repeatable solution and will require minimal human interventionfor future datasets from retailers. The input to this app would be product descriptions, tags, and other metadata.

    **C.Business application**–It is our hope that by immersing the students in solving a real world business problem with active business/technical support, that the students will gain immediate and valuable experience as theircompetitive edge in the evolving data science market.

    **D.Outfitting recommendation**–Given tagged data about different women’s fashion items, produce a customer recommendation system.
